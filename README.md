## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This was one of my first porjects using JavaScript. I built out the HTML to have the structure ready to go, which was a bit tedious in using select to write all the months, and dates 1-31 for the user to choose. Then I went on to JavaScript to actually get this proect running. Using a function and many conditionals, I was able to give a horoscope depending on the birthdate ranges. 

## Lessons Learned:

Im curious if there is an easier way to create the select in HTML without having to write all the dates... otherwise this really helped me solidify the concept of conditionals and how they are used, the difference between "==" and "===" as well which was super helpful. This really solidified my knowledge of JavaScript as I move on to more complex topics.
